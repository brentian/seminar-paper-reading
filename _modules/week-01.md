title: Multidimensional Data (Tensor) Analysis

---
**Abstract**{: .label .label-purple }

First, we provide an overview of higher-order tensor decomposition such as  the CP decomposition and its related applications. Then we introduce the computation of the principal components for a general tensor, known as the tensor principal component analysis (PCA) problem. We show that the general tensor PCA problem can be reducible to its special case, hence the tensor PCA problem can be solved by means of matrix optimization technique. Finally, we introduce a novel approximation scheme for tensor nuclear norm, which fills the gap of the approximation ration between tensor nuclear norm and tensor spectral norm.
