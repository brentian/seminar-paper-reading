    "title": "Stochastic Model-based Optimization",
    "content": "Abstract . We introduce a new interpretation of first-order methods from the perspective of model function. Using the framework of model-based optimization, the analysis of several existing algorithms can be unified succinctly. Specifically, we focus on the stochastic model-based optimization (SMOD), a class of nonsmooth nonconvex problems which are prevalent in machine learning. To make SMOD more practical, we make two important extensions: 1) we show that the popular momentum trick can be incorporated with SMOD. 2) when the model function satisfies certain good approximation property, even the nonsmooth problems can be linearly accelerated by minibatching. Furthermore, we also briefly cover the topic of distributed optimization and discuss the advantage of certain models in the asynchronous environment. | Advisor: Qi Deng | Organizer: Wenzhi Gao | .

    "title": "Multidimensional Data (Tensor) Analysis",
    "content": "Abstract . First, we provide an overview of higher-order tensor decomposition such as the CP decomposition and its related applications. Then we introduce the computation of the principal components for a general tensor, known as the tensor principal component analysis (PCA) problem. We show that the general tensor PCA problem can be reducible to its special case, hence the tensor PCA problem can be solved by means of matrix optimization technique. Finally, we introduce a novel approximation scheme for tensor nuclear norm, which fills the gap of the approximation ration between tensor nuclear norm and tensor spectral norm. | Advisor: Bo Jiang | Student: Chang He, Yuntian Jiang | .
